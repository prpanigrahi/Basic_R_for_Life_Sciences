## Introduction
The purpose of this section is to introduce you about the steps to install any R package from Bioconductor repository. We will demonstrate the installation and usage of Maftools package.  

Bioconductor provides tools for the analysis and comprehension of high-throughput genomic data. Bioconductor uses the R statistical programming language, and is open source and open development. It has two releases each year, 1383 software packages, and an active user community.

## Explore Maftools
For demo purpose we will explore maftools [1].  

Suppose you are doing a large scale sequencing project where you have done whole genome sequencing for ~100 patients and you have carried out variant detection pipeline to obtain variants (SNPs, Indels) in each sample. The variant information from each patient is aggregated in MAF file (Mutation Annotation Format. Now you want to analyze this MAF file. You searched in bioconductor for any pacakge that can help you to analyze MAF file and you came across maftools. 
  

### About MAFtools
With advances in Cancer Genomics, Mutation Annotation Format (MAF) is being widley accepted and used to store somatic variants detected. The Cancer Genome Atlas Project has seqenced over 30 different cancers with sample size of each cancer type being over 200. Resulting data consisting of somatic variants are stored in the form of Mutation Annotation Format. This package attempts to summarize, analyze, annotate and visualize MAF files in an efficient manner from either TCGA sources or any in-house studies as long as the data is in MAF format [2].

### About MAF file
MAF files contain many fields ranging from chromosome names to cosmic annotations. However most of the analysis in maftools uses following fields.

Mandatoty fields: Hugo_Symbol, Chromosome, Start_Position, End_Position, Variant_Classification, Variant_Type and Tumor_Sample_Barcode.

Complete specififcation of MAF files can be found on [NCI TCGA page](https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/display/TCGA/Mutation+Annotation+Format+(MAF)+Specification).

### Install maftools.  
source("https://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")  
biocLite("maftools")  

### Load maftools library
```{r}
library(maftools);
```

### Read example maf file
```{r}
# laml file path
laml.maf = system.file('extdata', 'tcga_laml.maf.gz', package = 'maftools');
# read laml maf file
laml = read.maf(maf = laml.maf, removeSilent = TRUE, useAll = FALSE);
```
### Print maf object
Summarized MAF file is stored as an MAF object. MAF object contains main maf file, summarized data and an oncomatrix which is useful to plot oncoplots (aka waterfall plots).

```{r}
laml;
```

### Structure of maf object
```{r}
str(laml);
```

### Shows sample summry.
```{r}
getSampleSummary(laml);
```

### Show frequently mutated genes.
```{r}
getGeneSummary(laml);
```

### Shows all fields in MAF
```{r}
getFields(laml);
```

### Plotting MAF summary
```{r}
plotmafSummary(maf = laml, rmOutlier = TRUE, addStat = 'median', dashboard = TRUE);
```

### Oncoplots

```{r}
#We will draw oncoplots for top ten mutated genes. (Removing non-mutated samples from the plot for better visualization)
oncoplot(maf = laml, top = 10, removeNonMutated = TRUE);
```

### Transition and Transversions.
```{r}
laml.titv = titv(maf = laml, plot = FALSE, useSyn = TRUE);
#plot titv summary
plotTiTv(res = laml.titv);
```
